GUI, CLI, Web UI ( user can only interact with)
	
	COCKPIT (is a program we can use anywhere)

	generative AI ops ( prompt or cmd will open the programs)

#ls ( will show the directory or file in the file in the folder/directory )

colors have their own mean it can be of different types but it can be any of... 
		blue-- directory
		white---

#ls -F (hyphen is also an options it is like flag)
	single hyphen means short double -- means long

-F ( we don't know the file or folder denote me)

#unalias ls ( to remove the existing settings like removing the color or any settings)


#ls -l (gives the detail of all the files creation time date and permissions) 
		*the time shows is modification time 

	we cannot see or find the creation time of file or folder.

# gedit vimalw ( we can create files and can write inside like notepad, we can give extension time also)

---------- arrow keys can find the history


#ls -l vimallw ( we can see the file details by typing it's name)

				************command [option] arguments***************
# touch aa ( to create the file it creates the empty file)


			*** we always need commands to do anything in the linux*******


# > lw123.txgt ( by this symbol we can create the file === exceptions)


# cd ( to change directory)
# cd lwfolder1
			--- use tabs to autocomplete------
#ls to see what inside the folder is 

# touch a ( to wrie inside the file) 
# touch {1..10} ( use range can also help accordingly ) 


			---- shell ( if cursor blinks it means someone is listening ) 
			---- the cursor is called shell also )


#mkdi d{1...10} (folder will be created 1 to 10) at once
#rm to remove file or directory

#rm 0f to remove file or directory forcefully..

#rm -f d{1..10} this command will help to remove file or dir without permission like yes no


#ls hello.txt ( can find the file is present or not ) 

		... we can do any programming in Linux terminal ...
#echo "Vimal" ( to print the same Vimal) it seems it a string

# y = date
#echo $y 
date

#y = `date` ( backticks to tell it like function ) 

# echo $y
Wed May 15 --------------
